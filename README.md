First, you'll need to generate a public/private key pair. You can use OpenSSL or a similar tool to generate these keys. Here's a simplified example of how to generate a key pair using OpenSSL:

```bash

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```
This command will generate a 4096-bit RSA private key (key.pem) and a self-signed certificate (cert.pem) valid for 365 days.
